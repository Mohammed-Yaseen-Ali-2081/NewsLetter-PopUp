# NewsLetter-PopUp
This code implements the ideology of news letter popup which we can embedd in our website in order to enhance it's features.
I've done this during my internship in the field of web development.
# What it does:
When any user logs in to our webpage this will automatically get popped up after a specified time delay(I've set it as 3secs).
There is a placeholder in order to take email of user as input when the subscribe button is clicked.
# Extra Features:
The popup appears with a smooth transition on to the screen making it look more beautiful(also does the same when closed).
The SUBSCRIBE button when hovered(mouse pointer placed on button) will change its color from one to another which give this popup a finishing extraordinary look :)
